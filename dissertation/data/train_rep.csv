It doesn't make sense to cause workplace tensions over leisure activities. If I were to try and fight with my colleague over who gets to take vacation, it would only complicate our relationship and make things worse in the long run. I feel that by conceding, I not only avoid unnecessary tension, I improve my standing with my supervisor. If any conflicts arise in the future, I will be able to point to this particular incident to show that I had already made a concession and that other people will need to reciprocate to maintain fairness in the workplace.",I would work on the project as soon as possible and aim to complete it ahead of schedule. This allows me to double check the work in the event that no further tasks are assigned. It also ensures that I have ample time to complete additional tasks if my boss decides to give me something else during the two-week period in which I have to complete the project. I prefer to avoid procrastinating whenever possible for fear of having too much on my plate with little time to accomplish everything assigned to me.,"I would attend the meeting regardless of what my colleague decides to do. Although I may not know anyone at the meeting, the entire purpose of the event is to make myself known to other people. This increases my visibility in the organization and with the organization's clientele. Not only will I be able to ingratiate myself with our clients, I will be opening doors for opportunities in the future. In some ways, it is better if my colleague does not attend because it prevents me from spending too much time with people I already know and instead forces me to be gregarious and meet with new and unfamiliar faces instead.","I would ask my supervisor additional questions regarding my performance. I might consider arguing my perspective and trying to explain why I think the feedback might be unwarranted. I think the best course of action would be to simply grin and bear it, then spend time thinking over what was discussed in our conversation. Nobody is perfect, and this negative feedback could be a lesson on being a more humble and conscientious worker. I would undoubtedly be frustrated by the negative feedback at first, but after I've had time to process my emotions, I would likely try to take the feedback into consideration and work on making the necessary changes in order to avoid negative consequences at work.",I would find the experience to be enjoyable.

That might be sufficient to receive a favorable response from my supervisor, if I was indeed the first to request this time off.  Failing that, I would try to reason with my colleague to see if perhaps some kind of arrangement could be made.  Perhaps (s)he would offer something in return for this vacation time, or would allow me to take it in return for some other favor at work.  If all else failed, I would recognize that it is my responsibility to help out at work during a busy time, so I would reschedule my vacation.  However, I would ask for something in return for the disruption this had caused to my vacation plans--perhaps some extra time off during a slower period.","I would try to get ahead on the project, in case any of these surprise tasks distract me later.  That is to say, I would try to do as much of the work on this scheduled project as soon as possible, so that I can maintain a light workload in the days leading up to the deadline.  I would also try to anticipate my boss's last-minute demands by giving regular updates on my progress, and reiterating how important it is that I continue to work with the same guidelines and expectations for the final finished product.  If any changes did occur, I would have time to work on them, but I would have to stress that so much work had already been done, under the original guidelines.","I would still attend the networking event, even without my colleague.  If (s)he actually does attend, then I would probably stay for the whole event, and try to encourage this coworker to join me in networking.  If I was alone, however, I would still check out the event, but with considerably less enthusiasm.  This may turn out to be a valuable opportunity to meet with employees at the client company, but if early signs were not encouraging, I would just leave early.  It would be better for me to recharge for the next day at my job than to spend a weary night networking with people who are not interested in meeting me.","I would try, guardedly, to argue my own case in this situation.  If my boss offered specifics, I would try to offer some evidence to show that perhaps (s)he was being too negative with the feedback.  Perhaps the boss thought I wasn't contributing enough to a team project, but I had a lot of notes showing my work along the way.  I might also try to show how extenuating circumstances might have caused a poor performance despite my best efforts.  In sum, I would try to rebut this negative feedback, but only in a respectful, truthful, and evidence-based way.","I would find this experience enjoyable, even if the thought of actually traveling to Norway is not very attractive to me.  I do enjoy learning about other cultures, and coincidentally, I am already quite interested in Scandinavia.

I feel that honestly is always the best policy and I would tell him/her that while I am very confident in my ability and I would stress that it is incredibly important that the work I put into the project is quality, but having extra tasks on top of this project could prevent me from completing the project. I would explain how important my performance is and just try to be as honest as possible in hopes that he/she will try to lighten my load until I completed the project.","I would try to talk my colleague into going anyway and explain why it is so important that we attend, since it's one of our largest clients.

If my colleague still doesn't want to go, I would try to bribe him or her in a friendly way, by offering a favor in return, whether it be trading time off or taking on an extra project of theirs. If he/she still won't go, I would have to suck it up and reluctantly go alone. I think this meeting is much more important than my pride in having to go alone.","It would really upset me and bother me, especially since I know it isn't true.

I would also tell my boss that I hold myself under the law of ethics and always strive to be honest and perform at my best.

It is good practice to start work as soon as possible in case I encounter any difficulties, or something happens outside of my control that delays me. In this scenario, it seems likely that my boss would assign additional, urgent work prior to the project due date, so I would like to build a buffer for myself to accommodate that should the need arise.","I would attend the networking meeting anyways because the whole purpose of networking is to meet new people and forge new relationships.

My real-life boss is like this, and this exact situation has come up many times. I have learned that I should aim to get projects done immediately, regardless of due date, as my boss does not accept that his sudden requests break my scheduling. It is better to make slight tweaks later, if new info is received, rather than spread out the work over time.

My hope would be that my teammate would take the hint and allow me first dibs on vacation dates for the year after this one. If needed, I would make such a suggestion directly to my colleague.","First of all, I would set up a timeline for myself with completion dates over the next two weeks for various steps in the process.

I would run the timeline by my boss or make her or him aware of how I plan to approach the project and use my time. Should my boss hand me last-minute tasks that would significantly throw off my project-completion timeline, I would be sure to tell him or her that the new task(s) would either delay my big project completion, or have themselves to be delayed until the big project is finished.

I would listen carefully and take notes. I would ask my manager -  either then or at a follow-up meeting - if she or he would mind my posing a few questions that could shed more light on the situation (or whatever gave rise to the negative feedback). Depending on how things went, I might also ask for the opportunity to write a response and have my response included in my personnel file. We would also have ""arbitration"" of some sort, where a trained third party would listen to both sides of our issue.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable and I would also, frankly, lobby for the opportunity to go to Norway on the company's dime!
