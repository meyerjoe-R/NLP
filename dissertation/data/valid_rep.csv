It would be easy to set my vacation for a week before or after my colleagues vacation. That way everyone is happy in this situation.,I would work on the project little by little during those two weeks to be prepared for anything that might come up in the future. You never know what is going to happen in life or what job obligations you are going to be asked to take care of. I think its better in this situation to get the project out of the way early rather than finish it late.,I would probably still go. Just depending on how my body feels at the end of the day.

I hope in the future they will remember my willingness to be flexible. I'm certain other people's plans are more important and inflexible than mine.

It is too much of a risk to put off the project knowing that other things may be put on my plate, preventing me from attending to this assigned project.

It is perhaps even more beneficial for the colleague to not attend, as I will be more likely to reach out of my comfort zone and get to chat and network with the clients, which will improve our working relationship.","I would accept the feedback from my manager. It's tough to get negative criticism, but it can be treated as an opportunity for growth. During the discussion with my manager, I would immediately ask if we can have a follow up meeting in about a week to allow us both time to brainstorm on how to improve my performance, and think about things that may have been hindering performance in the first place.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable.

Then I would go to my manager again to discuss why I think it was unfair.,I would find it to be exciting because of the opportunity to grow in my career.

I think my supervisor would appreciate my willingness to change the week and it is not a big enough issue to negotiate with my colleague since for some reason he is unwilling to change.  If I did need that week in particular, I would ask that both of us talk to the supervisor and decide who has a more compelling reason for vacation to be that week.  Based on this, a decision could be made.","I would immediately begin working on the project and finish it as quickly as I could and do an excellent job.  Two weeks can go by very quickly and as my boss may give me a last minute task it is very important to do the project when my work is lighter.  If the project involves waiting for information, I would finish all I could each day.   All most every project has some problems along the way and it is always best to not waste time along the way.  In this project, there is no time to waste.",I would definitely go to the networking meeting with one of my largest clients.  I would try to convince my colleague to come along but if they could not then I would introduce myself at the meeting and get to know the people.  It is very important to attend these meetings and completely expected that I would be there.  I would go with a very positive and upbeat attitude and try to enjoy the meeting.  I should know the people of my clients and should not have to rely on my colleague.,"I would be very upset about this situation and discuss my feelings with my manager.  If after this discussion, I still felt it was the feedback was not true and it did not change, I would talk to the next person in command.  However, I would only do this if I felt I was very wronged and I would tell my manager that I was going to talk to the next in command.  Doing this may hurt my relationship with my manager so I would only do this as a last resort.  Employers like employees who do not cause trouble and managers at all levels are part of the same teem so all of this needs to be considered and possible losing my job before I go to the next level.","I would really enjoy working on the project with the client from Norway.  I would find it very interesting to learn more about their country and culture.  I would be willing to travel if the need arose.

Also, by finishing the project early, and if I had spare time, I would continue reviewing the project to make sure it was completed to my high expectations.","I would try to convince my colleague to go for just a short time, meet and greet, and then could leave. If the colleague continued to decline going, I would go myself for a short period of time, who knows, I may meet someone interesting to network with.","I would ask the manager what prompted the negative feedback as my work had been positive in the past. I would ask the manager for enlightenment on how to turn around this negative feedback so that it doesn't happen in the future. Also, I would explain I was really counting on the annual bonus and if there was something I could do to make up for the negative feedback.","I would find the experience enjoyable as I like to learn about new cultures.

I would also request that everyone receive a copy of the company's protocol and rules for requesting vacation time so that I could prevent a situation like this in the future.","I would definitely do my best to knock out and complete the project as soon as possible. Since my workload is currently light, it would behoove me to use my downtime to work diligently and complete the project well before its due date.  It will take some pressure off. As well, additional work pops up that needs to be done later, I'll be able to focus on it without the stress of the project looming over my head.","I would encourage my colleague to come along.

It can also help my company so, I should go.","I would first take a deep breath and clear my head. Following that, I'd set aside some time to really think about what my manager said.

Ideally, this would allow the project to be completed with at least 3-4 days to spare.  By adhering to this schedule, a small buffer is already built into the work to allow for any additional tasks the boss may assign throughout the course of these two weeks.  Additionally, I would reach out to my boss and ask if he anticipates any tasks that may need completed during this two week period.","I would probably not go to the networking event.  Although I am not entirely antisocial, I like to compartmentalize the various aspects of my life.  When I am finished with work I like to go home and be done with it.  However, if the colleague went I would probably feel less awkward and might stay at the meeting for a bit to enhance connections in my field.","I would first clarify what the manager was telling me by asking how my performance is being measured.  Then I would request follow-up feedback and ask for suggestions to improve any areas where my performance is lacking.

I was a little miffed, but I understood the situation completely.","Again, this is something I have experienced in my current position. I never have a light workload, though. My boss' projects always take precedence over projects that I do for my coworkers.

I would also like to know if anything can be done to rectify the situation.","I would enjoy such an experience.

Because of such real consequences there is no reason for me to take such an insult and ignore it.

It looks better to get things done earlier.   I wouldn't wait to do the task.  I would portion it out to get it all done.,I would go because it'd make me look good.

10462856179,I would try to discuss with my co-worker what our vacations plans were. I would try to determine if either of us had already paid for the vacation. I would also try to see if either of us had made plans that would affect other people if we had to cancel travel. Then I would try to come up with a solution based on the information received.,I would continuously work on the project. I would tackle small bits at a time to make sure that it is finished before the due date. This would ensure my ability to complete all other tasks including unforeseen tasks to the best of my ability.,"I would first try to convince my colleague to join us. I would explain that it would be a benefit to us both individually as well as to the business. If they still did not want to attend, I wouldn't pass up the opportunity solely because I didn't know anyone. I would take the opportunity to go, and introduce myself to the clients.","I would feel upset and anxious about this situation. I would calmly ask the manager for proof of their claims, and let them know that such a strong claim could potentially have negative consequences on my livelihood. If the claims did turn out to be correct I would ask for direction to better my performance.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I would love to get paid to learn about a new culture while taking on a new deal with a client.

10459730914,I would first discuss the situation with my husband and see if he could also change his vacation week. I would then make it known that I was willing to change my vacation week to my boss and colleague. I believe this would help my connections and reputation in the office overall. I do not think it would be a huge sacrifice on my part as I would have enough time to re-plan the vacation.,I would walk very hard now to complete as much of the project as I can. I am aware that other projects can come up and I will remind myself to remain calm if and when it does. I will remain diligent in getting the project done in advance of the deadline.,"I would go to the networking meeting. While I may be tired and not knowing anyone there, I will remind myself how valuable this opportunity may be for my career. I would focus on the positives and the good that could come from the event.",I would feel very confused and upset in this situation. I feel like my work has been of the highest quality and I have not received negative feedback like this before. I would try to have another discussion with my manager and try to better understand his feedback and judgement. I would not be afraid to voice my own opinions. I would resolve to work even harder.,I would find this experience boring and would not volunteer to be involved in the project. I do not think I would have much to gain. Learning more about Norway's culture and history would not benefit me anyway except with this one client. I believe my time could be better spent in other ways.,4.0833333333,3.1666666667,3.0833333333,4.9166666667,1.75,Dev

That way, if the boss tosses me a last minute task, I'm free....and if he doesnt, I'm still free! I dont like putting things off til the last minute anyway.","I would have no choice but to meet my client, because that's my responsibility as an employee.","I would find out exactly what the issue was and do everything in my power to fix it. I dont like/want animosity in the workplace, not would I want to lose my bonus.","I honestly dont know what I would do. If I knew a bit more about Norway, I could answer this a bit better, but I dont. Another thing, there are too many variables and not enough info to answer.

10462919856,"I would adjust my vacation plans.  I typically plan far enough in advance that my vacations can be flexible.  I get along well with my co-workers, and I think this would be a sign of good faith with them.  I might tell them that they owe me a beer.","I would work hard to get the majority of the task finished in advance.  I might not actually complete the entire thing too far ahead of schedule, because that would be inviting more work to fall on me.  However, if I complete enough that I can relax, then I'll be able to handle additional tasks if they do come my way.","I would skip the event as well.  I'm not particularly good at networking, so if I don't have my colleague there to help grease the wheels I probably wouldn't be very effective.  If it's not a mandatory meeting, I'd be content missing it.","I would approach my manager with my response to his feedback.  If I can really justify why I don't think it's accurate feedback, I would have no problem communicating my concerns in a respectful manner.  It might not change his mind in the end, but it would at least send a message that I won't be bulldozed.","I would enjoy learning more about Norway for this project.  I love travel, so my preference would be to put my knowledge to use with an actual trip.  However, I think I would still be engaged in the process just because it feels similar to traveling.  I would feel connected.",4.75,4.9166666667,4.75,3.75,1.75,Dev

If I wasn't able to rearrange the dates and I couldnt get my money back I would reason with the boss.,I would probably wait until the last minute to do the project. That's just my nature and I get more done under pressure. It usually works out okay.,I would definitely not go. I'm not going to go to something where I don't know anyone. I'm anxious enough in situations like that as it is. No need to make it worse.,"I would go to the managers supervisor and tell them what's going on, as well as request a meeting with my manager and her supervisor to discuss the issues.","I would volunteer to do the project.

10459708204,To me it would depend on who put in their request first. So I would ask my supervisor to base the decision on who requested time off first. If it was them then I'd have no problem then taking vacation time if it was me then I would insist on taking the vacation time.,I would start working on the project immediately especially if I'm not that swamped and busy at work. That way if something else comes up or my boss gives me extra work at the last minute. I don't have to worry about feeling overloaded and overwhelmed. I don't put off for tomorrow what i can do today.,I would really try my hardest to persuade my friend and colleague to go. But if they chose not to I would be kind of bummed but I would still go. Whether I know someone or not the fact that one of my biggest client is involved makes that an important priority.,I would feel really bad and it would not be a pleasant feeling. But I also don't want to lose my bonus or possibly have that happened. So I would ask my boss what areas did they think that I could improve in and I would work on those areas really hard put my focus on doing my best. Then when my annual bonus time came if I got a bonus but I felt was fair i would have no problem if I didn't get my annual bonus and I know I did my best to improve I would look for other employment.,I would find the experience enjoyable and exciting.

If I work hard enough I can accomplish this.,I would say I wasn't going if they weren't going. I would be uncomfortable going alone. I would make an excuse not to go,I would be very upset.

This would allow me to do any other tasks my boss gives me during that time period. I would hope to have everything finished.,I would attend the outing. I would hope I’d make friends easily.

10460095413,"I would avoid doing anything. It's likely I put my vacation in first so I should get it. Worst case scenario is having management just deciding on who gets the week off. In most cases it'll go by seniority or position and if those are equal, simply whoever put it in first gets it. This way I don't have to deal with them being stubborn and I make someone else the bad guy.","I would plan out how long it would take for me to complete it under varying conditions. If I can get it done in a week with no interruptions then I'm safe. I can also dedicate time to helping other workers with their projects, in case I get a heavy workload from my boss, I can likely call in a favor from at least one person.","I would tell my colleague that it's fine if only I go. I'd simply remind them that in the future they'll likely have to go in my place and that I wouldn't mind getting all the credit from whatever happens at the meeting. If they then go with me, I now am no longer alone and if they don't I can avoid a future meeting I don't want to go to.","I would tell the truth as I am not afraid. If I can prove they're wrong and try to embarrass them by using whatever I've done as leverage. If I've interacted with their boss or someone they work along side, I can also use this to my benefit.
