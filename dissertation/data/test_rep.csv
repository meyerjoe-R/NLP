It also depends on what I plan on doing for vacation. If I am traveling, I would explain to my colleague that I have everything booked and it can't be changed. Now, if he asked first, then I would definitely try to change my plans, but I would ask him to consider changing his. I would try to bargain with him, if I needed to. I would tell them I'd deal with the crazy client so he wouldn't have to or help him with a project, but it really matters who asked first and whether my plans can be changed, if I asked first. If I asked first and he still refused to change, I would speak to my boss about it and explain why I think I should be able to take the time off. So, in the end, I would try to work with my colleague or bargain with him but only if I have to.","I would work to have the project finished early so that if my boss pulled me away from this project to work on something for them, I wouldn't have to work more to finish my project. This type of behavior is typical of my boss so I am very familiar with this situation. I'll be working on a project that I'm responsible for, with a deadline, and she will wait until the last minute to do something and drag me into it. So, with the due date in two weeks, I would aim to have it done in a week, at the most. If my boss pulls me away to work on their stuff, I'll have time and won't have to worry about finishing my project. If my boss doesn't come up with any last minute tasks, then I'll have time to polish up my project. It never hurts to take a final look at it before I consider it truly completed. It works even better if I step away from it for a little while and then come back to it. I can see it from a different perspective. With a boss like this, you have to be prepared to be interrupted because you can't turn them down.","I would try to talk my colleague into going with me. I would do this by stressing the importance of the client and how it will look to our boss if we don't go. If my colleague decided to not go, in the end, I would go alone because I would feel obligated to go because this is one of the firm's largest clients and it would look bad if I didn't.","I would feel unappreciated and upset but I would wait until I cooled down before I did anything. Then I would gather the information to rebut what my boss said. If I have the data to back up my claim that his interpretation (or views) are incorrect, I would definitely   schedule a meeting with him/her and ask them to elaborate on their feedback while also explaining why I think they are wrong. I have no problem standing up for myself when I'm wrongly accused of something and this definitely falls into that category. I would feel that if I didn't respond and at least try to correct the situation, then it will happen again. Through the years, I've learned that bosses are not always right and that if you don't stand up to them and fight for yourself, they will think that they can say anything about your work and get away with it. It's the opposite of the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In this situation, if the boss knows that they can't just come out and say something without being able to back it up, then they will think twice about saying anything negative. Sometimes it's predator and prey. I've worked for bosses that would get in a bad mood and take it out on someone but if you stood up for yourself, they left you alone. I'm never the prey.","I would find this project incredibly enjoyable. I love to learn about different cultures so this would really be a fun experience for me. It would also look good on my CV because in today's world, if you are able to say you've worked with different cultures, it looks really good.

Consider the deadline as make or break situation that could end your career.  Take it as an opportunity and let go of the threatening aspect of the situation. When you do this, you put your skills to win the challenge.  Before starting the work itself, if you’re worried about the situation then you won’t put your best to the work.

When you go to someone to talk, courteous enough to ask whether they are free and can spare few minutes. Don’t jump into every conversation without invitation. Be open to help","I take all feedback seriously, as it either directly addressees gaps/issues with my performance OR informs me what information gaps / misperceptions people may have about my performance. So, I do think it pays to listen fully.    If I disagree with the feedback, I don’t think it pays to be combative or defensive. I would look at it as an opportunity to clarity what the other person doesn’t know. So, for example, if someone told me they think I need to do a better job of communicating to Team ABC about a project — and I think I have done that well — I may reply something like, “would you mind if I walked you through my communications to that team to date, and you can help me identify what may have been unclear?”    So, turn it into a win-win. Either you clarify in that discussion that you did communicate well. OR, you get some more productive feedback that you originally received on how to tweak your work to be more effective.",Helping others has great benefits of helping the giver. It reinforces information needed to improve ones own life. It's satisfying feeling being part of the solution rather then the problem. Helps with self esteem.
