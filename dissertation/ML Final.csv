If my colleague has requested the same vacation time as me then guess it would be whoever asked first. So if i asked first then it should be me going on the vacation at that time and vice versa.,I would finish the project. Using all of my time a resources as soon as possible i would get the project done quickly. If i knew my boss would do this then i would plan accordingly.,I would still go to the meeting. If i go then i would learn more things about my client. I would also look better then my colleague because it shows dedication.,i would feel very discouraged. Sometimes the feedback we get isn't always going to be positive but it will make us correct our mistakes in the long run. I would definitely think about what my manager said and think of ways i could better myself.,I would find this experience enjoying as i like learning new things especially about a different culture. I when i volunteer that would make me and the company look good. I would also be able to maybe be able to relate to the client in some ways knowing their culture.,I'm not exactly sure what id do in this situation.

Now, if he asked first, then I would definitely try to change my plans, but I would ask him to consider changing his. I would try to bargain with him, if I needed to. I would tell them I'd deal with the crazy client so he wouldn't have to or help him with a project, but it really matters who asked first and whether my plans can be changed, if I asked first.

It's the opposite of the squeaky wheel gets the grease. In this situation, if the boss knows that they can't just come out and say something without being able to back it up, then they will think twice about saying anything negative.

Since I realize that other unexpected assignments might be given to me before the ""known"" deadline for this assigned project, I will dedicate as much time as possible right now and get it done early.

I would then talk to my colleague about us planning our vacations better next time. We could tell each other the dates we plan on taking our vacation before we set them so they don't overlap.,I would go ahead and get the project started and maybe finished if that was possible. If I didn't have anything else to work on then that would be the best time to work on the project. I would also tell my boss when I had it finished to see if they had anything I needed to change.,I would go ahead and go. It is a meeting with a large client and chances are me being there will lead to the client becoming more interested in our company. I would also try and talk my colleague into going so that we could work together.,I would go over the facts of the feedback. I would see what I could have done differently rather than telling my boss that I don't agree. I maybe would also talk to my colleagues about it to see what their thoughts were.,I would find this experience very enjoyable. I enjoy learning about different countries and cultures. I also think that the client would be able to give me a lot of details about Norway.,I would allow my colleague to take their vacation first if they asked for the week off first.

I feel it would only be fair being that neither of us wants to give up our week that it be decided by who made the request first. This way it is fair to both of us as well as the company. In the future I would suggest the company track requests better that way such a thing doesn't cause conflict between employees.,I would attempt to complete it early that way I can use any additional time left over to tinker with it and possibly improve it. By doing so I would also save myself in case my boss does add additional tasks onto the project I would have ample time to address them. I think it's important to always do your best and in a timely fashion so it I would approach it with full steam. There's no reason to slack on it as getting it done earlier is only better.,I would try to convince my coworker to attend the event. I'd mention how great the meeting would be for networking and upwards mobility for both of us. If after some discussion they were still adamant on not going for the evening I'd go by myself. Solo or with a colleague either way its a good opportunity for me to improve my career so I would go.,I would feel pretty horrible about this as I hold my manager's opinion very highly. I would take a day or two to really mull it over and consider the feedback. Depending on if after some serious thought I still felt it was untrue I would look to possibly having it reviewed by my manager's boss. If such feedback can affect my bonus and it is really invalid I would want it reviewed by someone else to really find out what was going on.,I would find the experience enjoyable and could be really quite neat. It's interesting to learn new things and a brand new culture would be cool. It might be a difficult experience to some degree as I wouldn't even understand their language but I'm a fast learner so I'd give it my best shot.,I would ask my supervisor who had put in the request for vacation time first.

During the second week, I would consider those tasks less important than the project.  If the tasks are low priority I would just delay them a bit, and prioritize the project.  Of course, I would explain all these details to my boss.

If this colleague is another person, I would let this person know that I will certainly not forget it, and that I will repay my debt.   I would choose this way, because I think it is important to talk and to negotiate with my colleagues.
