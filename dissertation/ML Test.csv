The reason I would do this is to make this situation easier for everyone that is involved. It would be easy to set my vacation for a week before or after my colleagues vacation.

You never know what is going to happen in life or what job obligations you are going to be asked to take care of. I think its better in this situation to get the project out of the way early rather than finish it late.,I would probably still go. Just depending on how my body feels at the end of the day. A networking meeting with one of my largest clients is important regardless of who else will be there. I would want to do what is best for my career.,I would see what I could to do to improve the feedback from my manager. Your not always going to agree with what a manager says 100% of the time.

future.",124,6,0.04838709677419355,89,1,0.011235955056179775,72,0,0.0,73,1,0.0136986301369863,50,1,0.02,408,6,0.014705882352941176,4,4,6,2,2,1,2,0,6,2,4,5,6,6,5,6,2,5,6,5,2,2,1,1,8,4,4,5,2,5,0,2,4,1,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,0,5,17,23,18,6,21,9,4,0,383,402,4.42741935483871,4.134831460674158,4.333333333333333,4.52054794520548,4.74,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,0,4,0,6,2,4,5,17,2,2,1,1,6,3,2,4,9,4,1,4,4,4,0,0,8,6,2,0,6,14,4,1,0,6,5,4,1,0,11,2,1,3,5,12,1.5544220378673819,1.0485828737130218,0.7682988062023175,0.25998917637619534,0.5553475612357043,0.7899977966825071,0.48678129640012385,-0.08809763918432063,-0.05972588991616818,0.03911713441115654,-1.0203249120308855,0.1755214045357041,0.4541371778670716,-1.6280149442612282,0.9321523755094013,-0.0471618027074378,1.2874134338456709,0.9501883680634344,0.7638003871051363,2.66285546012184,-0.791143528905361,1.8980173779273013,-1.7313781109641404,2.4883212490385604,-4.2438695791471215,-0.10907636425187557,-0.8409890426351595,2.5536168073244587,-2.160099241302142,1.6879172304098424,1.2614835639527393,0.6356959985697719,-0.3479312843759134,0.7854354531004613,-0.6203085030456295,0.213842847835535,672,7.8,456,8.4,383,9.1,402,11.6,286,8.6,2203,8.9,570,408,54,20,1.4,20.4,67.69,8.9,8.142857142857142,6.74,11.5,7.54,39,5.419354838709677,5.123595505617978,5.319444444444445,5.506849315068493,5.72,5.3995098039215685,-1.1487638518599597,0.02266967223218988,0.1207921361612706,0.1257495507905966,0.5563504951294984,0.7205641910092332,3.163265831683499,4.434082079276243,1.338551641202836,1.946112638377506,0.44252726643714274,-0.04537699900868743,1.449959659854751,-0.8942199879750435,-0.8627935139051395,0.9193281513392707,0.16284883791665303,-0.11462323562761581,0.5460984755068076,0.397968244295768,0.19192227080102725,1.9816272733382043,1.3925752001354852,0.3014594367626627,0.9392136084905714,1.518413902341841,2.631149870019961,0.9427098064116066,0.9893973680475456,0.09858151072812808,1.084930015376492,-0.5834184320572693,2.239456589284531,0.34013073288305945,0.35708057547970373,1.4438860440999863,1.9120913951532195,0.790496855995347,2.260928102163025,1.8152651954117476,0.6201178346660157,0.44790497113586347,1.7427407367380892,1.3765309722710004,0.7689718128685986,1.1494092589110416,-0.1498584847751999,0.8438066860415654,5.11088120961158,1.6354276920307425,0.2543876066021593,1.7728902748022755,0.9224151063524394,1.825818275937381,-0.8366913892539082,0.5813226074049553,2.663863407355827,0.7865246299553337,-0.08098970391801348,-0.2604186227471063,0.6771403525073462,1.254373061930873,1.4921104297542005,-0.6006164286487565,-0.4541371778670716,-0.1755214045357041,0.792640405889136,1.6310478613239545,2.3628877106651602,1.525022087463545,0.9321523755094013,2.8611696966931186,1.9867805750745164,1.0203249120308855,0.23535639185541066,1.5544220378673819,1.0485828737130218,0.7682988062023175,0.25998917637619534,0.5553475612357043,0.7899977966825071,0.48678129640012385,-0.08809763918432063,-0.05972588991616818,0.03911713441115654,0.6771403525073462,1.254373061930873,1.4921104297542005,-0.6006164286487565,-0.4541371778670716,1.0203249120308855,-0.1755214045357041,2.2404807858523577,0.32084364860426795,0.3622868089106766,1.4416990400627687,1.6280149442612282,0.7689718128685986,1.1494092589110416,-0.1498584847751999,0.8438066860415654,0.9321523755094013,-0.0471618027074378,1.2874134338456709,0.9501883680634344,0.7638003871051363,2.66285546012184,0.791143528905361,1.518413902341841,2.1310484250346886,2.0291355299910836,-0.6982703218538343,-0.5979772389996132,1.7313781109641404,1.9120913951532195,0.8252956021024107,-1.0659326946794083,1.8152651954117476,1.6588808326923736,3.395095663317697,-0.08726109140150046,-0.8409890426351595,2.5536168073244587,2.792906083850818,2.4291533329374397,-0.04758501055313254,-0.5831715601422288,2.160099241302142,0.6654588675216586,-0.031501583978842666,0.3216440011572147,1.3765309722710004,1.1252781536065617,1.5544220378673819,1.048582873713022,0.7682988062023187,0.25998917637619645,0.5553475612357057,0.789997796682508,0.4867812964001248,-0.08809763918432062,-0.059725889916168166,0.039117134411156516,-1.0203249120308855,0.17552140453570408,0.45413717786707164,-1.6280149442612282,0.9321523755094012,-0.04716180270743775,1.2874134338456709,0.9501883680634344,0.7638003871051364,2.6628554601218406,-0.791143528905361,1.518413902341841,-1.7313781109641404,1.6588808326923739,-3.395095663317697,-0.08726109140150046,-0.8409890426351596,2.5536168073244587,-2.160099241302142,1.1252781536065617,0.8409890426351596,1.5143598352955485,-0.5391954281335688,1.2719053904080988,-1.07871574439888,0.5167858275526791,3.30220363161404,-0.31372420188544814,1.9738137397355562,-0.12811241185404712,1.5544220378673819,0.04573318901774459,1.0485828737130218,0.1794810276322432,0.6581671029966756,-0.1192149947000764,2.0693948883474698,-0.12619851737703558,2.0827052773579813,1.9816272733382043,2.02318955053112,1.3013424658611437,0.7971867424665315,-0.1980289063472808,0.008497255207472748,-0.12619851737703558,-0.1935925792231711,0.0

I would welcome the opportunity to learn about Norway and its culture. By volunteering for involvement in this project, I would make myself more valuable to my company, and may also be positioning myself for favorable recognition when my review time comes
